```

###Pages
* The `/` path leads to a page introducing my portfolio with a gallery of completed projects
* The `/about` path is an profile of the developer, including contact information and a list of technologies known
* The `/projects` path requires an additional subpath that is a number (e.g., http://example.com/projects/0) that corresponds to a developer project, and will show a page containing information about that project including a live demo and link to the project repo.

###Style features

* The fadeInLeft animation brings the developer info into the screen from the left side.  

* The color palette can easily be changed from the `:root` pseudo-selector, and many attributes including background color, text color, link color, and box shadows have their values set using the `:root` variables.
